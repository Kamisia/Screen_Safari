## Description

The Screen Safari project utilizes the TMDB API to showcase movie posters from two categories: 'Top Rented' and 'Most Popular', presented in an interactive carousel format. The application also allows users to search for movies by name, enhancing usability. Upon hovering over a poster, users are presented with a movie rating. The posters are clickable, leading users to a modal with a movie description upon clicking.
